# stale

You need to setup the next lines in the scale.js: SCALE_URL and SCALE_API

Where and how to get them is explained here: https://github.com/nai-degen/TavernAIScale/  

Copy URL as whole, and paste it into SCALE_URL variable. Then unblur API Key, copy it, and paste into SCALE_API. 
Next, start scale.js by using the following terminal command: node scale.js.
After the code is started, copy written URL and paste it into SillyTavern's reverse proxy.
