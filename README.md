# Stale

You need to setup the following lines in the scale.js: SCALE_URL and SCALE_API

Information on where and how to obtain them can be found here: https://github.com/nai-degen/TavernAIScale/  

Copy the entire URL, then paste it into the SCALE_URL variable. Next, unblur the API Key, copy it, and paste it into the SCALE_API variable.</br>
Once the code has started, copy the displayed URL and paste it into SillyTavern's reverse proxy.
